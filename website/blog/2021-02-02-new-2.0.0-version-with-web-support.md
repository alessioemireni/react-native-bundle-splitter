## Introduction

The react-native framework is actively developing. If earlier it was difficult to find a library that would support two platforms (iOS and Android) at the same time, now it is the de facto standard.

And the boundaries of influence of the react-native framework are expanding. The development team plans to add support for Windows, macOS as the default platform.
